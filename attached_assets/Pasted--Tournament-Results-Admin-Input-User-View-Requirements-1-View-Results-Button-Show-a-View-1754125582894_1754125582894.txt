🏁 Tournament Results – Admin Input & User View Requirements
✅ 1. "View Results" Button
Show a "View Results" button only when the tournament has officially ended.

Users should not see this button while the tournament is still ongoing.

🛠 2. Admin: Inputting Tournament Results
Admins will enter results for both:

Group Stage Matches

Knockout Stage (Bracket) Matches

Both sections must behave like an Excel-style interface, with the following features:

📋 Group Stage Matches
Admin can:

Add or remove columns and rows dynamically

Fill in match data for each cell (e.g. Player A vs Player B, score)

When entering player names:

The system should auto-suggest from registered user accounts

Selected players will be linked to their profile page

🧾 Knockout (Bracket) Matches
Similar behavior:

Dynamic addition/removal of rounds and players

Player search and selection from user base

Score entry

Visual structure (e.g. Round of 8, Semifinal, Final)

Again, players' names must be clickable and link to their profiles.

👀 3. User View: Tournament Results Page
Once results are entered:

Users can view:

Full group stage results in a clean, table-like format

Full knockout bracket in a structured visual view

All player names are clickable, leading to their profile pages

Logged-in players can go to their profile and see their match history from that tournament.

💡 Optional Enhancements (suggested)
Highlight winners in brackets/tables

Display match stats per player (wins, losses, total points)

Show final rankings or placement (e.g. 1st place, 2nd place...)

🧪 Example Workflow:
Tournament ends

Admin opens result editor

Inputs group + knockout data (Excel-style)

Results saved

“View Results” button appears for users

Players & visitors see structured results and click through to profiles

Хэрвээ хүсвэл энэ үр дүн оруулах Excel загварыг React дээр хэрхэн хийх жишээ (editable table component), эсвэл Firebase/Express backend-тэй яаж холбох код өгч болно. Хэлээд л өгөөрэй.








Та хэлэхдээ:
Хэрэглэгчид харагдах байдал иймэрхүү хүснэгтээр харагдах ёстой. Хүснэгтээр харагдуулах учраас хүснэгтээр тоглолтын үр дүн оруулмаар байна. Бас нугалааны зураг өгсөн. Нугалааг бас ингэж схемээр харуулмаар байгаа учраас нугалааны үр дүн оруулахад схем зурж оруулмаар байна. Бас үр дүн оруулж болохгүй байна. Чамд нэг site link өгсөн санаа аваарай


ChatGPT хэлсэн:
Маш тодорхой ойлгомжтой шаардлага байна. Энийг англиар, Replit эсвэл хөгжүүлэлтийн багт ойлгомжтой байдлаар functionality + UX/UI + admin input + error condition-ийн хамт өгч болох хэлбэрээр орчуулж байна:

🖥 User-Facing Match Results Display
✅ 1. Group Stage Results — Table Format
Group stage match results must be displayed in a clean table format for users.

Because of that, admins must also input the results via a table interface (similar to Excel).

The table should include:

Player names

Scores

Win/Loss status

Group position/rank (optional)

Example table:

Player A	Player B	Score	Winner
Bat Erdene	Bold Ganbaatar	3–1	Bat Erdene
Davaa Munkh	Sain Erdenee	2–3	Sain Erdenee

✅ 2. Knockout Stage — Visual Bracket (Tree Diagram)
The knockout stage must be displayed as a bracket-style diagram, not just a list.

Admins must be able to input the knockout round results via a visual bracket editor:

Drag-and-drop or structured input of each round and match

Select players from the system

Input scores

The bracket should update visually in real-time as matches are entered

Example structure:

css
Хуулах
Засах
Quarterfinals         Semifinals           Final
-------------         ------------         -------
Player A   ┐
           ├──> Player A ┐
Player B   ┘            │
                        ├──> Player A (Champion)
Player C   ┐            │
           ├──> Player C ┘
Player D   ┘
All player names must be clickable and lead to their user profile.

❌ 3. Problem: Result Submission Not Working
You mentioned that admin is currently unable to submit match results.

Please ensure the following:

Backend allows saving of both group & bracket data

All required fields are filled before submission

Proper error messages are shown when saving fails
