Маш тодорхой ойлгомжтой шаардлага байна. Энийг англиар, Replit эсвэл хөгжүүлэлтийн багт ойлгомжтой байдлаар functionality + UX/UI + admin input + error condition-ийн хамт өгч болох хэлбэрээр орчуулж байна:

🖥 User-Facing Match Results Display
✅ 1. Group Stage Results — Table Format
Group stage match results must be displayed in a clean table format for users.

Because of that, admins must also input the results via a table interface (similar to Excel).

The table should include:

Player names

Scores

Win/Loss status

Group position/rank (optional)

Example table:

Player A	Player B	Score	Winner
Bat Erdene	Bold Ganbaatar	3–1	Bat Erdene
Davaa Munkh	Sain Erdenee	2–3	Sain Erdenee

✅ 2. Knockout Stage — Visual Bracket (Tree Diagram)
The knockout stage must be displayed as a bracket-style diagram, not just a list.

Admins must be able to input the knockout round results via a visual bracket editor:

Drag-and-drop or structured input of each round and match

Select players from the system

Input scores

The bracket should update visually in real-time as matches are entered

Example structure:

css
Хуулах
Засах
Quarterfinals         Semifinals           Final
-------------         ------------         -------
Player A   ┐
           ├──> Player A ┐
Player B   ┘            │
                        ├──> Player A (Champion)
Player C   ┐            │
           ├──> Player C ┘
Player D   ┘
All player names must be clickable and lead to their user profile.

❌ 3. Problem: Result Submission Not Working
You mentioned that admin is currently unable to submit match results.

Please ensure the following:

Backend allows saving of both group & bracket data

All required fields are filled before submission

Proper error messages are shown when saving fails
